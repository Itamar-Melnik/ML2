# Insurance Fund Performance Analysis

This project analyzes insurance fund performance using classification and clustering techniques to predict fund Alpha levels and uncover meaningful patterns. The dataset includes various financial metrics, such as yields, market exposures, and risk-adjusted performance indicators.

## Objectives

### Classification
Predict whether a fund's Alpha level is high or low based on financial features using supervised machine learning algorithms.

### Clustering
Discover patterns in the dataset by grouping funds with similar characteristics using unsupervised learning techniques.

## Models Used

### Classification
Supervised learning algorithms used for classification include:
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting**
- **XGBoost**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)**

### Clustering
Unsupervised learning algorithms used for clustering include:
- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Agglomerative Clustering**
- **DBSCAN**

## Repository Structure
- **`data/`**: Folder containing the raw dataset.
